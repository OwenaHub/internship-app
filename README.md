My Contribution - Hybreed

What I implemented
. I added clean semantic HTML structure (main, header, labels, etc.)
. I also improved form setup and accessibility (aria-labels, also id and name)
. Created a clean, simple CSS layout following the instructions
. I then implemented JavaScript core features:

- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Auto-update of tasks left counter

My desired results:
. To match proper front-end workflow standards expected in real teams.
. To make the code accessible, readable and maintainable.
. To ensure the User Interface works smoothly without errors(correct class names and input handling)
. In addition I also in the process prepared the project for future features like filtering and localStorage.

Please test with live server by adding, marking, deleting tasks. Also Confirm the footer counter updates correctly.
All succesful but just 'failed to load resource' is the only console error i'm experiencing.
